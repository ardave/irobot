F# interface to [iRobot Create 2 Robotics kit](http://store.irobot.com/default/create-programmable-programmable-robot-irobot-create-2/RC65099.html)

Currently attempting to lay down some code based solely on owner's manual description of the Open Interface protocol, while the physical unit ships via ground.

Serial IO will use https://github.com/jcurl/SerialPortStream.
