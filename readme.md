F# interface to [iRobot Create 2 Robotics kit](http://store.irobot.com/default/create-programmable-programmable-robot-irobot-create-2/RC65099.html)

Code thus far is based solely on owner's manual description of the Open Interface protocol, while the physical unit ships via ground.

Initially targeting Mono over Dotnet Core due to better Raspberry Pi compatibility.

Serial IO will use https://github.com/jcurl/SerialPortStream.
